Gram-Positive Bacteria
======================

Streptococcus and Enterococcus
------------------------------
- Gram-positive cocci in pairs or chains
- Catalase negative
- Facultative anaerobes
- Classification methods:

  - Serologic properties: Lancefield groupings (A, B)
  - Hemolytic patterns: complete hemolysis (β), incomplete hemolysis (α), no hemolysis (γ)
  - Biochemical (physiologic) properties

- Main groups:

  - β-hemolytic streptococci 

    - Classified by Lancefield groupings (group-specific cell wall antigens, usually carbohydrates)
    - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A), Streptococcus agalactiae (group B)

  - α-hemolytic and γ-hemolytic strptococci

    - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Viridans streptococci

  - Enterococci 

    - Group D streptococci, share group D cell wall antigens
    - Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium

Streptococcus pyogenes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Biology
"""""""
- Gram-positive cocci in chains, β-hemolytic
- Components in peptioglycan cell wall:

  - group-specific carbohydrate (Lancefield group A antigen)
  - type-specific protein (M protein)
  - M-like surface proteins, lipoteichoic acid, F protein

- Some strains have capsule

Pathogenesis
""""""""""""
- Host-parasite interactions

  - Avoid phagocytosis: hyaluronic acid capsule
  - Interfere complement system: M protein (block the binding of C3b), C5a peptidase
  - Adherence to host cells: lipoteichoic acid, M protein, F protein
  - Invade epithelial cells: M protein, F protein

- Toxins and enzymes

  - Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (spe): superantigens, responsible of severe diseases
  - Streptolysin S: lyse blood cells, responsible for β-hemolysis, nonimmunogenic
  - Streptolysis O: lyse blood cells, oxygen-liable, induce antistreptolysin O (ASO) antibodies which is useful in ASO test, inhibited by cholesterol so cutaneous infections won't induce ASO antibodies
  - Streptokinase (A and B): lyse blood clots and facilitate rapid spread, antistreptokinase antibodies are useful markers for infections
  - DNases (A to D): depolymerize free DNA, antibodies against DNase B are important marker for cutaneous infections (anti-DNase B test)

Epidemiology
""""""""""""
- 1st cause of bacterial pharyngitis, 2nd cause of pyoderma (second to Staphylococcus aureus)
- Group A streptococci can colonize the oropharynx of healthy persons, but S. pyogenes isolated from patient with pharyngitis is significant
- Pharyngitis primarily infects children, but infants and adults are also susceptible
- Spread through respiratory droplets (pharyngitis) or direct contact (soft-tissue infections)

Diseases
""""""""
- Pharyngitis

  - Sore throat, fever
  - Scarlet fever: erythematous rash from chest to extremities, circumoral pallor, strawberry tongue, Pastia lines

- Pyoderma (inpetigo)

  - Confined purulent infection of the skin
  - Caused by direct contact, seen in children with poor personal hygiene

- Erysipelas and cellulitis

  - skin inflammation (erythema, warmth), lymph node enlargement, systemic signs
  - Cellulitis involves deeper subcutaneous tissues but erysipelas not

- Necrotizing fasciitis

  - Infections that spread along the fascia with extensive destruction of muscle and fat 
  - Toxicity, multiorgan failure, and death are hallmarks
  - Must be treated with aggressive surgical debridement instead of antibiotic only

- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome

  - From soft-tissue inflammation to shock and organ failure 

- Bacteremia
- Rheumatic fever 

  - Nonsuppurative complication following streptococcal pharyngitis 
  - Pancarditis, damage to heart valves 
  - Arthralgias, arthritis
  - Diagnosed by positive throat culture or detection of antibody 

- Acute glomerulonephritis

  - Nonsuppurative complication following pharyngeal or pyodermal streptococcal infections
  - Acute inflammation with edema, hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria
  - Diagnosed by clinical presentation and evidence of S. pyogenes infections

Diagnosis
"""""""""
- Microscopy:

  - Gram stains of soft-tissue infections
  - Observation of streptococci in a respiratory specimen is not significant (streptococci are part of the normal population)

- Antigen detection

  - Antibodies react with group-specific carbohydrates
  - Detect group A streptococci in throat swabs

- Nucleic acid-based tests

  - Probe assay or amplification assay

- Culture

- Identification:

  - Group-specific carbohydrate (group A streptococci)
  - Bacitracin positive, PYR positive (S. pyogenes)

- Antibody detection:

  - ASO test, anti-DNase B test 
  - Useful for confirming rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis

Treatment
"""""""""
- Oral penicillin V or amoxicillin used to treat streptococcal pharyngitis 
- Oral cephalosporin or macrolide for penicillin-allergic patients
- Drainage and surgical debridement for serious soft-tissue infections 
- Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with a history of rheumatic fever (before they undergo procedures)

Streptococcus agalactiae
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Biology
"""""""
- Gram-positive cocci in chains, β-hemolytic
- Serologic markers:

  - Group-specific cell wall polysaccharide B antigen 
  - Type-specific capsular polysaccharides (Ia, Ib, II ~ VIII)
  - Surface proteins (c antigen)

Pathogenesis
""""""""""""
- Polysaccharide capsule: interferes with phagocytosis, antibody against it is protective
- Complement pathways required for killing group B streptococci: systemic spread in premature infants with low complement level
- Sialic acid: inhibit complement pathway

Epidemiology
""""""""""""
- Colonize lower gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract
- Infect infants born to colonized mothers
- Most common cause of bacterial septicemia and meningitis
- Risk in adults is greater in pregnant women

Diseases
""""""""
- Early-onset neonatal disease

  - Acquire in utero or at birth, develop during the first week
  - Bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis (CSF examination is required)
  - May cause severe neurologic sequelae

- Late-onset neonatal disease

  - Acquire from exogenous source, develop between 1 week to 3 months
  - Bacteremia with meningitis
  - Neurologic complications are common

- Infections in pregnant women

  - Postpartum endometritis, wound infection, urinary tract infection

- Infections in men and nonpregnant women

  - Bacteremia, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, skin and soft-tissue infections
  - Infect patients with compromised immunity

Diagnosis
"""""""""
- Antigen detection (not sensitive), nucleic acid-based tests, culture
- Identification: S. agalactiae is the only group B Streptococcus

Treatment
"""""""""
- Penicillin
- Cephalosporin or vancomycin in penicillin-allergic patients
- All pregnant women should be screened for colonization
- Chemoprophylaxis should be used for women colonized or at high risk (intravenous penicillin G or ampicillin at least 4 hours before delivery)

Viridans streptococci
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Heterogeneous collection of α-hemolytic and nonhemolytic strptococci (include Streptococcus pneumoniae)
- Colonize oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract
- Most are susceptible to penicillin, but S. mitis can be resistant

Streptococcus pneumoniae
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Biology
"""""""
- Encapsulated gram-positive coccus in pairs (diplococci) or short chains
- α-hemolytic result from pneumolysin
- Can only grow on enriched media supplemented with blood products
- Capsular polysaccharides used for serologic classification and polyvalent vaccine
- C-polysaccharide can participate C-reactive protein
- F antigen can cross-react with Forssman surface antigens
- Phosphorylcholine regulates cell wall hydrolysis (crucial for the activity of amidase)

Pathogenesis
""""""""""""
- Colonization and migration

  - Surface protein adhesins: bind the bacteria to epithelial cells
  - Secretory IgA protease: prevent being trapped in mucus by secretory IgA
  - Pneumolysin: destroy epithelial cells and phagocytic cells

- Tissue destruction

  - Teichoic acid & peptidoglycan fragments: activate the alternative complement pathway, augmented by amidase
  - Pneumolysin: activate the classic complement pathway
  - Hydrogen peroxide: damage tissue
  - Phosphorylcholine: help bacteria enter host cells

- Phagocytic survival

  - Capsule: anti-phagocytic protection (so encapsulated strains are virulent but nonencapsulated strains are avirulent)
  - Specific soluble substances: the capsular polysaccharides

Epidemiology
""""""""""""
- Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common inhabitant of the throat and nasopharynx in healthy people
- Pneumococcal disease occurs when organisms spread to lungs (pneumonia), paranasal sinuses (sinusitis), ears (otitis media), meninges (meningitis)
- Disease is most common in children and the elderly with low levels of antibodies against the capsular polysaccharides
- Pneumococcal diseases is most commonly associated with an antecedent viral respiratory disease (e.g. influenza) or chronic pulmonary disease

Diseases
""""""""
- Pneumonia

  - Often has a viral respiratory tract infection 1 to 3 days before the onset
  - Productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, chest pain (pleurisy)
  - Generally localized in the lower lobes of the lungs (lobar pneumonia)

- Sinusitis & otitis media

  - Acute infections of the paranasal sinuses and ear
  - Preceded by viral infections
  - Otitis media is primarily seen in young children, but sinusitis can occur in patients of all ages

- Meningitis

  - Streptococcus pneumoniae can spread into the central nervous system after bacteremia, infections of the ear or sinuses, or head trauma

- Bacteremia

  - Commonly occurs in patients with pneumonia and meningitis but not in sinusitis or otitis media
