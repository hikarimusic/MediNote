================

Staphylococcus and Related Gram-Positive Cocci 
----------------------------------------------

- Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus (catalase positive), Streptococcus & Enterococcus (catalase negative)
- Staphylococcus: grow and cause disease in various conditions, found on skin and musous membrane of humans, important pathogen
- Species: **S.aureus** (**coagulase positive**, most virulent, **MRSA**), **S.epidermidis**, **S.lugdunensis**, **S.saprophyticus** (**coagulase negative**, less virulent)

Physiology and Structure 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Capsule and Slime Layer
"""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Polysaccharide capsule**: inhibit phagocytosis by PMNs 
- **Slime layer** (**biofilm**): binds bacteria to tissues and foreign bodies

Peptidoglycan and Associated Enzymes 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Gram-positive bacteria cell wall: thick **peptidoglycan** layer with **many cross-linked layers** making it rigid 
- **Penicillin-binding protein**: 

  - **enzymes** that catalyze construction of peptigoglycan layer
  - targets of penicillins and other β-lactam antibiotics
  - bacterial resistance from acquisition of gene coding for novel penicillin-binding protein, ex: **mecA** gene in **MRSA**

- Peptidoglycan has endotoxin-like activity, stimulates immune responses

Teichoic Acids and Lipoteichoic Acids 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Teichoic acids**: **species-specific** component of cell wall, binds to peptidoglycan layer or cytoplasmic membrane (**lipoteichoic acids**)

Surface Adhesion Proteins 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Also called **microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMN) proteins**
- Including staphylococcal protein A, fibronectin-binding proteins A & B, clumping factor proteins A & B (**coagulase**)
- Functions: bind organisms to host cells and establish infection, some are unique to S.aureus and serve for identification 

Cytoplasmic Membrane 
""""""""""""""""""""

- Cytoplasmic membrane: osmotic barrier and providing anchorage for enzymes 

Pathogenesis and Immunity 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Pathogenesis: **evade**, **adherence**, **tissue destruction**

Regulation of Virulence Genes 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Accessory gene regulator (agr) operon**: regulate protein expression based on population density (low density: colonization and growth, high density: invasion)
- Innate immune regulation: apolipoprotein suppresses agr signaling

Defenses Against Innate Immunity 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Capsule** and **slime layer**: inhibits phagocytosis 
- **Protein A**: bind to immonoglobulins and prevents antibody-mediated clearance

Staphylococcal Toxins 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Includes cytotoxins, exfoliative toxins, enterotoxins. TSST-1.
- **Superantigens**: 
  - include exfoliative toxin A, enterotoxins, TSST-1 
  - bind to MHC II, interact with **VβTCR**, result in massive release of cytokines

Cytotoxins 
''''''''''

- **Alpha toxin**: bind to cell surface and form pore, lead to osmotic swelling and cell lysis 
- **Beta toxin**: also called **sphingomyelinase C**, catalyze hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids
- **Delta toxin**: has cytolytic activity
- **Gemma toxin** & **P-V leukocidin**: bicomponent toxins, hemolytic or leukotoxic 

Exfoliative Toxins  
''''''''''''''''''

Enterotoxins

Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1
