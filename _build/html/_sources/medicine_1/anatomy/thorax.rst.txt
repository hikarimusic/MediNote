Thorax 
======

- Thorax: between neck and abdomen (chest: include pectoral girdle)
- Thoracic cavity: circumference increasing inferiorly
- Thoracic cage: protects thoracic and abdominal viscera 
- Divided into: mediastinum, right pulmonary cavity, left pulmonary cavity
- Containing: lungs, heart, esophagus, (breast)

Thoracic Wall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Functions: 

  - protect thoracic and abdominal organs
  - resist negative internal pressures
  - attach and support upper limbs
  - provide attachment of muscles 

- Rigid but flexible

Skeleton of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Thoracic skeleton: 12 pairs of ribs and costal cartilages, 12 thoracic vertebrae, intervertebral discs, sternum 

Ribs, Costal Cartilages, and Intercostal Spaces 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Ribs: light weight but resilient, contain bone marrow

  - true ribs: 1st - 7th, directly connect to sternum (through cartilage)
  - false ribs: 8th - 10th, indirectly connect to sternum (through cartilage above)
  - floating ribs: 11th, 12th, does not connect to sternum

- Typical ribs: 3rd - 9th

  - head: has two facets separated by crest of the head (N-th ribs connects N-th and (N-1)-th vertebra)
  - neck: connects head and body 
  - tubercle: articular part: articulates with transverse process, nonarticular part: attaches costotransverse ligament
  - body: curves at costal angle, costal groove protects intercostal nerve and vessels inferiorly 

- Atypical ribs: 1st, 2nd, 10th - 12th

  - 1st rib: broadest and shortest, one facet for T1, two grooves superiorly for subclavian vessels, scalene tubercle separates two grooves and attaches anterior scalene muscle
  - 2nd rib: two facets for T1 and T2, tuberosity for serratus anterior 
  - 10th rib: one facet 
  - 11th & 12th rib: one facet, no neck or tubercle 

- Costal cartilages: 1st - 7th connect sternum independently, 8th - 10th connect with superior cartilages and form costal margin, 11th - 12th form caps on rib heads
- Intercostal spaces: N-th intercostal space is between N-th and (N+1)-th ribs, space below T12 is subcostal space

Thoracic Vertebrae 
""""""""""""""""""

- Thoracic vertebrae: 

  - bilateral costal facets (demifacets) on vertebral bodies superiorly and inferiorly for heads of ribs
  - costal facets on transverse processed for tubercles for ribs 
  - long spinous processes 

- Typical thoracic vertebrae: paired demifacets superiorly and inferiorly
- Atypical thoracic vertebrae:

  - T1: superior costal facets are not demifacet 
  - T10 - T12: only one pair of costal facets 

- Spinous process: long and slope inferiorly, protects spinal canal 
- Articular processes:

  - superior articular processes face posteriorly and slightly laterally
  - inferior articular processes face anteriorly and slightly medially
  - bilateral joint planes permit small rotation

The Sternum 
"""""""""""

- Protects mediastinal viscera (heart)
- Consists of manubrium, body, and xiphoid process, connected by cartilaginous joints and ossify during adulthood
- Manubrium: jugular notch, clavicular notch, synchondrosis of the first rib, manubriosternal joint (sternal angle)
- Body of the sternum: T5 - T9, costal notches, transverse ridges, fused by 4 sternebrae
- Xiphoid process: T10, xiphisternal joint, infrasternal angle, superior limit of liver, inferior border of heart 

Thoracic Apertures 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Smaller superior opening: communicates with neck and upper limbs 
- Larger inferior opening: provides origin of diaphragm 

Superior Thoracic Aperture 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Bounded: T1, 1st ribs and costal cartilages, superior border of manubrium 
- Pass: trachea, esophagus, nerves, vessels 

Inferior Thoracic Aperture 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Bounded: T12, 11th & 12th ribs, costal margin (7th - 10th costal cartilages), xiphisternal joint 
- Diaphragm: 

  - separates thoracic and abdominal cavities
  - esophagus and inferior vena cava: pass through openings on diaphragm
  - aorta: pass posterior to diaphragm 

- Diaphragm rises to T4, so liver, spleen, and stomach lie superior to inferior thoracic aperture 

Joints of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Movements of individual joints are small but crucial for respiration

Costovertebral Joints 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Joints of heads of ribs:

  - head of N-th rib articulate with superior costal facet of TN, inferior costal facet of T(N-1), and IV disc between them 
  - intra-articular ligament of head of rib: connects crest of head and IV disc 
  - radiate ligament of head of rib: from heads of ribs to bodies of vertebrae 

- Costotranscerse joints:

  - costotransverse ligament: from neck of rib to transverse process 
  - lateral costotransverse ligament: from tubercle of rib to tip of transverse process 
  - suprior costotransverse ligament: from neck of rib to transverse process superior to it 
  - Allow rotation (1st - 6th) and gliding (7th - 10th)

Sternocostal Joints 
"""""""""""""""""""

- 1st: synchondrosis of the 1st rib, 2nd - 7th: synovial joints with radiate sternocostal ligaments

Movements of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Movements of thoracic wall > volume and pressure changes > inspiration and expiration
- Vertical dimension: increase during inspiration (diaphragm descends)
- AP dimension: increase considerably during inspiration (intercostal muscles contract, upper ribs movement)
- Trans dimension: increase slightly during inspiration (intercostal muscles contract, lower ribs movement)

.. admonition:: Clinical

    **Chest pain**: may result from pulmonary, cardiac, intestinal, gallbladder or musculoskeletal disorders, 
    crucial to discriminant between serious conditions and minor causes, 
    heart attack presents crushing substernal pain that does not disappear with rest

    **Rib fractures**: 1st rib rarely fractured but when broken may injure brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, 
    middle ribs most commonly fractured and may injure lung or spleen, lower ribs fractures may result in diaphragmatic hernia,
    rib fractures are painful

    **Flail chest**: multiple rib fractures allows a segment of thoracic wall to move freely and paradoxically,
    is extremely painful and impairs ventilation

    **Thoracotomy, intercostal space incisions, and rib excision**: anterior thoracotomy makes H-shapes cuts through costal cartilages,
    posterior thoracotomy entry through lateral approach of 5th-7th intercostal spaces, 
    rib retraction allows procedures through a single intercostal space,
    rib excision provides better access for example pneumonectomy

    **Supernumerary ribs**: cervical ribs are relatively common and may interfere neurovascular structures exiting superior thoracic aperture,
    lumbar ribs are less common 

    **Protective function and aging of costal cartilages**: costal cartilages provide resilience to prevent sternum and ribs fractures,
    are elastic in children and undergo calcification in the elderly

    **Ossified xiphoid process**: ossified xiphoid process may appear as hard lump is epigastric fossa

    **Sternal fractures**: not common and usually comminuted without displacement, may cause heart or lung injuries 

    **Median sternotomy**: sternum is divided in the median plane and retracted to gain access to the mediastinum

    **Sternal Biopsy**: sternal body is often used for bone marrow needle biopsy, 
    obtain specimen for transplantation or detection of metastatic specimens

    **Sternal Anomalies**: complete sternal cleft is uncommon and through which heart may protrude, sternal foramen is not clinically significant,
    pectus excavatum (funnel chest) is receding sternum, pectus carinatum (pigeon breast) is projecting sternum,
    xiphoid process is commonly perforated in elderly persons and not clinically significant

    **Thoracic outlet syndrome**: arteries and nerves emerging from thorax are affected by obstructions of superior thoracic aperture,
    manifestations involve upper limb

    **Dislocation of ribs**: dislocation of sternocostal joint or interchondral joint common in body contact sports, 
    cause severe pain and lump-like deformity at the site

    **Separation of ribs**: dislocation of costochondral junction

    **Paralysis of diaphragm**: injury to one phrenic nerve causes paralysis of half of the diaphragm, 
    detect radiographically from the paradoxical movement of the paralyzed half

Muscles of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Axio-appendicular muscles extend from thoracic cage to upper limb and act primarily on upper limb
- Pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, serratus anterior, and scalene muscles are accessory respiratory muscles 
- True muscles of thoracic wall: serratus posterior, levatores costarum, intercostal, subcostal, transversus thoracis 
- Serratus posterior muscles: serratus posterior superior elevates upper ribs, serratus posterior inferior depresses lower ribs, may not be primarily motor but have proprioceptive function 
- Levatores costarum muscles: elevate ribs
- Intercostal muscles: occupy intercostal spaces, external intercostals > internal intercostals > intercostal vessels and nerves > innermost intercostals

  - External intercostal muscles: runs infero-anteriorly from tubercles of ribs to superior borders of rib below,
    anteriorly replaced by external intercostal membranes,
    continuous with external oblique muscles, active during inspiration
  - Internal intercostal muscles: run infero-posteriorly from costal grooves of ribs to superior borders of rib below,
    posteriorly replaced by internal intercostal membranes,
    continuous with internal oblique muscles, active during expiration (especially interosseous portions)
  - Innermost intercostal muscles: similar to internal intercostals 

- Subcostal muscles: from internal surface of angle of rib to internal surface of second or third rib inferior to it
- Transversus thoracis muscles: radiate superolaterally from posterior aspect of inferior sternum, continuous with transversus abdominis
- Diaphragm is the primary muscle of inspiration, intercostal muscles is to support by resisting paradoxical movement
- Muscles fibers approximating slope of ribs rotates ribs superiorly, fibers perpendicular to slope of ribs rotates ribs inferiorly
