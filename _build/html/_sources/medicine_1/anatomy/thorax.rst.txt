Thorax 
======

- Thorax: between neck and abdomen (chest: include pectoral girdle)
- Thoracic cavity: circumference increasing inferiorly
- Thoracic cage: protects thoracic and abdominal viscera 
- Divided into: mediastinum, right pulmonary cavity, left pulmonary cavity
- Containing: lungs, heart, esophagus, (breast)

Thoracic Wall
-------------

- Functions: 

  - protect thoracic and abdominal organs
  - resist negative internal pressures
  - attach and support upper limbs
  - provide attachment of muscles 

- Rigid but flexible

Skeleton of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Thoracic skeleton: 12 pairs of ribs and costal cartilages, 12 thoracic vertebrae, intervertebral discs, sternum 

Ribs, Costal Cartilages, and Intercostal Spaces 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Ribs: light weight but resilient, contain bone marrow

  - true ribs: 1st - 7th, directly connect to sternum (through cartilage)
  - false ribs: 8th - 10th, indirectly connect to sternum (through cartilage above)
  - floating ribs: 11th, 12th, does not connect to sternum

- Typical ribs: 3rd - 9th

  - head: has two facets separated by crest of the head (N-th ribs connects N-th and (N-1)-th vertebra)
  - neck: connects head and body 
  - tubercle: articular part: articulates with transverse process, nonarticular part: attaches costotransverse ligament
  - body: curves at costal angle, costal groove protects intercostal nerve and vessels inferiorly 

- Atypical ribs: 1st, 2nd, 10th - 12th

  - 1st rib: broadest and shortest, one facet for T1, two grooves superiorly for subclavian vessels, scalene tubercle separates two grooves and attaches anterior scalene muscle
  - 2nd rib: two facets for T1 and T2, tuberosity for serratus anterior 
  - 10th rib: one facet 
  - 11th & 12th rib: one facet, no neck or tubercle 

- Costal cartilages: 1st - 7th connect sternum independently, 8th - 10th connect with superior cartilages and form costal margin, 11th - 12th form caps on rib heads
- Intercostal spaces: N-th intercostal space is between N-th and (N+1)-th ribs, space below T12 is subcostal space

Thoracic Vertebrae 
""""""""""""""""""

- Thoracic vertebrae: 

  - bilateral costal facets (demifacets) on vertebral bodies superiorly and inferiorly for heads of ribs
  - costal facets on transverse processed for tubercles for ribs 
  - long spinous processes 

- Typical thoracic vertebrae: paired demifacets superiorly and inferiorly
- Atypical thoracic vertebrae:

  - T1: superior costal facets are not demifacet 
  - T10 - T12: only one pair of costal facets 

- Spinous process: long and slope inferiorly, protects spinal canal 
- Articular processes:

  - superior articular processes face posteriorly and slightly laterally
  - inferior articular processes face anteriorly and slightly medially
  - bilateral joint planes permit small rotation

The Sternum 
"""""""""""

- Protects mediastinal viscera (heart)
- Consists of manubrium, body, and xiphoid process, connected by cartilaginous joints and ossify during adulthood
- Manubrium: jugular notch, clavicular notch, synchondrosis of the first rib, manubriosternal joint (sternal angle)
- Body of the sternum: T5 - T9, costal notches, transverse ridges, fused by 4 sternebrae
- Xiphoid process: T10, xiphisternal joint, infrasternal angle, superior limit of liver, inferior border of heart 

Thoracic Apertures 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Smaller superior opening: communicates with neck and upper limbs 
- Larger inferior opening: provides origin of diaphragm 

Superior Thoracic Aperture 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Bounded: T1, 1st ribs and costal cartilages, superior border of manubrium 
- Pass: trachea, esophagus, nerves, vessels 

Inferior Thoracic Aperture 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Bounded: T12, 11th & 12th ribs, costal margin (7th - 10th costal cartilages), xiphisternal joint 
- Diaphragm: 

  - separates thoracic and abdominal cavities
  - esophagus and inferior vena cava: pass through openings on diaphragm
  - aorta: pass posterior to diaphragm 

- Diaphragm rises to T4, so liver, spleen, and stomach lie superior to inferior thoracic aperture 

Joints of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Movements of individual joints are small but crucial for respiration

Costovertebral Joints 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Joints of heads of ribs:

  - head of N-th rib articulate with superior costal facet of TN, inferior costal facet of T(N-1), and IV disc between them 
  - intra-articular ligament of head of rib: connects crest of head and IV disc 
  - radiate ligament of head of rib: from heads of ribs to bodies of vertebrae 

- Costotranscerse joints:

  - costotransverse ligament: from neck of rib to transverse process 
  - lateral costotransverse ligament: from tubercle of rib to tip of transverse process 
  - suprior costotransverse ligament: from neck of rib to transverse process superior to it 
  - Allow rotation (1st - 6th) and gliding (7th - 10th)

Movements of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Movements of thoracic wall > volume and pressure changes > inspiration and expiration
- Vertical dimension: increase during inspiration (diaphragm descends)
- AP dimension: increase considerably during inspiration (intercostal muscles contract, upper ribs movement)
- Trans dimension: increase slightly during inspiration (intercostal muscles contract, lower ribs movement)

.. admonition:: Clinical

    **Chest pain**: may result from pulmonary, cardiac, intestinal, gallbladder or musculoskeletal disorders, 
    crucial to discriminant between serious conditions and minor causes, 
    heart attack presents crushing substernal pain that does not disappear with rest

    **Rib fractures**: 1st rib rarely fractured but when broken may injure brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, 
    middle ribs most commonly fractured and may injure lung or spleen, lower ribs fractures may result in diaphragmatic hernia,
    rib fractures are painful

    **Flail chest**: multiple rib fractures allows a segment of thoracic wall to move freely and paradoxically,
    is extremely painful and impairs ventilation

    **Thoracotomy, intercostal space incisions, and rib excision**: anterior thoracotomy makes H-shapes cuts through costal cartilages,
    posterior thoracotomy entry through lateral approach of 5th-7th intercostal spaces, 
    rib retraction allows procedures through a single intercostal space,
    rib excision provides better access for example pneumonectomy

    **Supernumerary ribs**: cervical ribs are relatively common and may interfere neurovascular structures exiting superior thoracic aperture,
    lumbar ribs are less common 

    **Protective function and aging of costal cartilages**: costal cartilages provide resilience to prevent sternum and ribs fractures,
    are elastic in children and undergo calcification in the elderly

    **Ossified xiphoid process**: ossified xiphoid process may appear as hard lump is epigastric fossa

    **Sternal fractures**: not common and usually comminuted without displacement, may cause heart or lung injuries 

    **Median sternotomy**: sternum is divided in the median plane and retracted to gain access to the mediastinum

    **Sternal Biopsy**: sternal body is often used for bone marrow needle biopsy, 
    obtain specimen for transplantation or detection of metastatic specimens

    **Sternal Anomalies**: complete sternal cleft is uncommon and through which heart may protrude, sternal foramen is not clinically significant,
    pectus excavatum (funnel chest) is receding sternum, pectus carinatum (pigeon breast) is projecting sternum,
    xiphoid process is commonly perforated in elderly persons and not clinically significant

    **Thoracic outlet syndrome**: arteries and nerves emerging from thorax are affected by obstructions of superior thoracic aperture,
    manifestations involve upper limb

    **Dislocation of ribs**: dislocation of sternocostal joint or interchondral joint common in body contact sports, 
    cause severe pain and lump-like deformity at the site

    **Separation of ribs**: dislocation of costochondral junction

    **Paralysis of diaphragm**: injury to one phrenic nerve causes paralysis of half of the diaphragm, 
    detect radiographically from the paradoxical movement of the paralyzed half

Muscles of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Axio-appendicular muscles extend from thoracic cage to upper limb and act primarily on upper limb
- Pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, serratus anterior, and scalene muscles are accessory respiratory muscles 
- True muscles of thoracic wall: serratus posterior, levatores costarum, intercostal, subcostal, transversus thoracis 
- Serratus posterior muscles: serratus posterior superior elevates upper ribs, serratus posterior inferior depresses lower ribs, may not be primarily motor but have proprioceptive function 
- Levatores costarum muscles: elevate ribs
- Intercostal muscles: occupy intercostal spaces, external intercostals > internal intercostals > intercostal vessels and nerves > innermost intercostals

  - External intercostal muscles: runs infero-anteriorly from tubercles of ribs to superior borders of rib below,
    anteriorly replaced by external intercostal membranes,
    continuous with external oblique muscles, active during inspiration
  - Internal intercostal muscles: run infero-posteriorly from costal grooves of ribs to superior borders of rib below,
    posteriorly replaced by internal intercostal membranes,
    continuous with internal oblique muscles, active during expiration (especially interosseous portions)
  - Innermost intercostal muscles: similar to internal intercostals 

- Subcostal muscles: from internal surface of angle of rib to internal surface of second or third rib inferior to it
- Transversus thoracis muscles: radiate superolaterally from posterior aspect of inferior sternum, continuous with transversus abdominis
- Diaphragm is the primary muscle of inspiration, intercostal muscles is to support by resisting paradoxical movement
- Muscles fibers approximating slope of ribs rotates ribs superiorly, fibers perpendicular to slope of ribs rotates ribs inferiorly

Surface Anatomy of Thoracic Wall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Viscera of Thoracic Cavity 
--------------------------

- Thoracic cavity is divided into three compartments:

  - Right and left **pulmonary cavities**: contain lungs and pleura 
  - Central **mediastinum**: between two pulmonary cavities, contain heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, thymus 

Pleurae, Lungs, and Tracheobronchial Tree 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Each pulmonary cavity is lined with pleural membrane (**pleura**) which also reflects onto and cover lungs
- Fist in balloon: inner wall is visceral pleura, outer wall is parietal pleura, cavity is pleural cavity, inner and outer walls are continuous at root and form pleural sac
- Developing lungs invaginate **pericardioperitoneal canals**, the precursors of pleural cavities 

Pleurae 
"""""""

- Each lungs is enclosed in serous **pleural sac** containing visceral pleura and parietal pleura
- **Pleural cavity**: space between layers of pleura, contain **serous pleural fluid** which lubricates and keeps lung surface in contact with thoracic wall 
- **Visceral pleura**: cover and adhere to lungs surfaces (including surfaces in fissures), continuous with parietal pleura at **hilum of lung** (where structures of root of lung enters and leave lung)
- **Parietal pleura**: adhere to thoracic wall & mediastinum & diaphragm, contain costal & mediastinal & diaphragmatic parts
- **Costal part of parietal pleura**: cover internal surface of thoracic wall, separated from it by endothoracic fascia
- **Mediastinal part of parietal pleura**: cover lateral aspects of mediastinum 
- **Diaphragmatic part of parietal pleura**: cover superior surface of diaphragm on each side of mediastinum, connected to diaphragm by **phrenicopleural fascia**
- **Cervical pleura**: cover apex of lung and form **pleural cupula** extending into neck, reinforced by **suprapleural membrane** (attach to 1st rib and C7 vertebra)
- Parietal pleura changes direction at lines of pleural reflection, left and right pulmonary cavities are asymmetrical (due to heart)
- **Sternal lines of pleural reflection**: between costal pleura and mediastinal pleura anteriourly, right line descends in anterior median line to xiphoid process (6th rib), left line descends and turns left (4th rib) and creates bare area of pericardium (contact with anterior wall)
- **Costal lines of pleural reflection**: between costal pleura and diapgragmatic pleura, passing obliquely across midclavicular line (8th rib) and midaxillary line (10th rib) to the posterior side
- **Vertebral lines of pleural reflection**: between costal pleura and mediastinal pleura posteriorly, run in paravertebral line from T1 to T12
- **Costodiaphragmatic recesses**: potential pleural spaces above diaphragm, lungs move into recess during inspiration and retract during expiration (costomediastinal recessess: pleural recesses posterior to sternum)

Lungs 
"""""

- **Lungs**: light, spongy and elastic organ of respiration, with 

  - **apex**: superior end ascending into root of neck
  - **base**: concave surface resting on dome of diaphragm 
  - two or three lobes: created by one or two fissures 
  - three surfaces: costal, mediastinal, diaphragmatic 
  - three borders: anterior, inferior, posterior 

- **Right lung**: divided into three **right lobes** (**superior**, **middle**, **inferior**) by two **fissures** (**oblique**, **horizontal**), larger but shorter than left lung (right dome of diaphragm is higher), anterior border is straight
- **Left lung**: divided into two **left lobes** (**superior**, **inferior**) by one **fissure** (**oblique**), anterior border has deep **cardiac notch**, anterior and inferior parts of superior lobe indented by heart and leaving **lingula**
- **Costal surface of lung**: convex, posterior part is called vertebral part of costal surface 
- **Mediastinal sufrace of lung**: concave, include hilum receiving root of lung, embalmed cadaver has cardiac impression on both lungs, groove for esophagus on right lung, groove for arch of aorta and descending aorta on left lung 
- **Diaphragmatic surface of lung**: concave, form **base of lung**, cancavity is deeper in right lung (due to liver)
- **Anterior border of lung**: where costal and mediastinal surfaces meet anteriorly
- **Inferior border of lung**: circumscribe diaphragmatic surface of lung
- **Posterior border of lung**: where costal and mediastinal surfaces meet posteriorly 
- **Roots of lungs**: include bronchi, pulmonary arteries and veins, pulmonary plexuses of nerves, lymphatic vessels

  - pulmonary artery: superiormost on left (superior lobar bronchus may be superiormost on right)
  - superior and inferior pulmonary veins: anteriormost and inferiormost, respectively 
  - main bronchus: middle of posterior boundary 

- **Hilum of lung**: wedge-shaped area on mediastinal surface where root of lung passes, lung root enclosed by continuity between parietal and visceral pleura (**pleural sleeve**)
- **Pulmonary ligament**: continuity between parietal and visceral pleura inferior to root of lung 

Tracheobronchial Tree 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- **Tracheobronchial tree**: sublaryngeal airway
- Trachea: bifurcate at level of transverse thoracic plane (sternal angle) 
- **Main bronchi**: enter lungs at hila 

  - **right main bronchus**: wider, shorter, more vertically 
  - **left main bronchus**: inferior to arch of aort, anterior to esophagus and thoracic aorta 

- **Lobar bronchi**: two on left and three on right, each supplies a lobe 
- **Segmental bronchi**: supply **bronchopulmonary segments**:

  - largest subdivisions of lobes, pyramidal-shaped segments separated by septa, named by supplying segmental bronchi 
  - supplied independently by a segmental bronchus and tertiary branch of pulmonary artery, drained by intersegmental parts of pulmonary veins which lie between and drain adjacent segments 
  - 10 in right lung, 8-10 in left lung, surgically resectable 

- **Bronchioles**: lack cartilage in walls 

  - **conducting bronchioles**: transport air but lack glands or alveoli, end as **terminal bronchioles** 
  - **respiratory bronchioles**: transport air and exchange gas, give rise to alveolar ducts 

- **Pulmonary alveolus**: basic unit of gas exchange 

  - **alveolar ducts**: airways lined with alveoli 
  - **alveolar sacs**: clusters of alveoli 

Vasculature of Lungs and Pleurae 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Pulmonary arteries**: 

  - right and left pulmonary arteries arise from pulmonary trunk at level of sternal angle
  - divided into **lobar arteries** (superior, middle [right only], inferior) and **segmental arteries**, paired with bronchi

- Pulmonary veins: 

  - **superior** and **inferior** pulmonary veins on each side (**middle lobe vein** is tributary of right superior pulmonary vein)
  - coursing between and receiving blood from adjacent bronchopulmonary segments 
  - veins from visceral pleura and bronchial circulation (except central region) drains into pulmonay veins (veins from parietal pleura drains into systemic veins) 

- **Bronchial arteries**: 

  - **left bronchial arteries**: two, directly from thoracic aorta 
  - **right bronchial arteries**: one, indirectly from upper posterior intercostal arteries (3rd) or common trunk with left superior bronchial arteries 
  - supply upper esophagus, branches of bronchi, and visceral pleura (parietal pleura is supplied by arteries supplying thoracic wall)

- **Bronchial veins**:

  - drain part of blood from bronchial arteries (primarily proximal part of lung) 
  - right bronchial vein drains into azygos vein, left azygos vein drains into accessory hemi-azygos vein or left superior intercostal vein 

- **Pulmonary lymphatic plexuses**: 

  - **subpleural lymphatic plexus**: drain lung parenchyma and visceral pleura, drain into **bronchopulmonary lymph noded** 
  - **bronchopulmonary lymphatic plexus**: drain structures of root of lung, drain into **pulmonary lymph noded** and then into bronchopulmonary lymph nodes 
  - bronchopulmonary lymph nodes drain into **superior** and **inferior** tracheobronchial lymph nodes, right lung and left lung (inferior lobe) drain into nodes of right side, left lung (superior lobe) drain into nodes of left side 
  - tracheobronchial lymph nodes drain into **right** and **left** bronchomediastinal lymph trunks, terminate at venous angles (into right lymphatic duct and thoracic duct)
  - lymph from parietal pleura drain into lymph node of thoracic walls, some lymph from cervical parietal pleura drain into axullary lymph node  

Nerves of Lungs and Pleurae 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Pulmonary plexus**: nerves of lungs and visceral pleura, contain parasympathetic, sympathetic, and visceral afferent fibers
- Parasympathetic fibers: presynaptic fibers from vagus nerve, synapse with parasympathetic ganglion cells, are bronchioconstrictor, vasodilator, secretory to alveolar glands 
- Sympathetic fibers: postsynaptic fibers from paravertebral sympathetic ganglion of sympathetic trunks, bronchiodilator, vasoconstrictor, inhibitory to alveolar glands 
- Visceral afferent fibers: reflexive (associated with reflexes) or nociceptive (conducting pain)

  - reflexive visceral afferent fibers: accompany parasympathetic fibers, convey impulses from mucosa (tactile), muscles (stretch), interalveolar connective tissue (Hering-Breuer reflexes), pulmonary arteries (pressor receptors), pulmonary veins (chemicoreceptors)
  - nociceptive afferent fibers: accompany sympathetic fibers (from visceral pleura and bronchi) or parasympathetic fibers (from trachea)

- Nerves of parietal pleura: from intercostal nerves (peripheral part) and phrenic nerves (central part)

Surface Anatomy of Pleurae and Lungs 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Cervical pleura and apices of lungs: deep to **supraclavicular fossae**
- Lines of pleural reflection and borders of lungs:

  - lie between 2th and 4th costal cartilages 
  - move inferolaterally (left, indented by cardiac notch) and inferiorly (right) to 6th costal crtilage
  - pass midclavicular line at 8th rib (parietal plerua) and 6th rib (lung)
  - pass midaxillary line at 10th rib (parietal pleura) and 8th rib (lung)
  - pass scapular line at 12th rib (parietal pleura) and 10th rib (lung)

- Fissures:

  - oblique fissure: extend from T2 vertebra posteriorly to 6th costal cartilage anteriorly 
  - horizontal fissure: extend along 4th rib and costal cartilages 

.. admonition:: Clinical

    **Injuries of cervical pleura and apex of lung**: cervical pleura and apex of lung project into neck and may be injured in wounds to base of neck resulting in pneomothorax 

    **Injury to other parts of pleurae**: pleurae descend inferior to costal margin at right infrasternal angle and right & left costovertebral angles (posterior to suprior poles of kidneys), may be injured in surgical procedure 

    **Pulmonary collapse**: rupture of lung surface or penetration of thoracic wall may result in entrance of air into pleural cavity, tension between visceral & parietal pleura break and lung will collapse (one side only since pleural sacs do not communicate), open-chest surgery uses positive-pressure pump

    **Pneumothorax, hydrothorax and hemothorax**: pneomothorax (air in pleural cavity) results from penetrating wound or pulmonary lesion, hydrothorax (fluid in pleural cavity) results from pleural effusion, hemothorax (blood in pleural cavity) result from injury to intercostal or internal thoracic vessel (an air-fluid level will be seen in hemopneumothorax)

    **Thoracentesis**: insert needle into 9th intercostal space (at superior border and high enough to avoid intercostal nerve and vessels and colateral branch) in midaxillary line during expiration (avoid inferior border of lung) with needle angle upward (avoid deep side of costodiaphragmatic recess)

    **Insertion of a chest tube**: incision in 5th or 6th intercostal space in midaxillary line, tube directly superiorly to remove air or inferiorly to remove fluid, connected to underwater drainage system to prevent air from being sucked back 

    **Pleurectomy and pleurodesis**: pleurectomy (excision of part of pleura) and pleurodesis (induce adherence of parietal and visceral pleura) prevent recurring spontaneous secondary atelectasis

    **Thoracoscopy**: diagnostic and therapeutic procedure examining pleural cavity with thoroscope, imcision via 1-3 intercostal spaces 

    **Pleuritis (pleurisy)**: pleuritis causes pleural rub (lung surfaces become rough, detectable during ascultation of lung), pleural adhesion (parietal and visceral layers adhere), sharp pain especially on exertion

    **Variations in lobes of lung**: absent or extra fissures change the number of lobes, most common accessory lobe is azygos lobe in rihgt lung 

    **Appearance of lungs and inhalation of carbon particles and irritants**: lungs are light pink (healthy children, people livng in clean environment) or dark and mottled (smoker, people living in urban), lungs can accumulate considerable amount of carbon without being adversly affected 

    **Auscultation of lungs and percussion of thorax**: auscultation of lungs assesses airflow through tracheobronchial tree, percussion of thorax helps establish whether the underlying tissue is air filled or fluid filled or solid 

    **Aspiration of foreign bodies**: more likely to enter right main bronchus since it is wider shorter and more vertecal, aspiration is a hazard encounterd by dentists

    **Bronchoscopy**: endoscope for inspecting interior of tracheobronchial tree, morphological changes in carina (cartilaginous ridge between main bronchi) are important diagnostic signs (lymph node enlargement distort carina), mucous membrane covering carina is sensitive and associated with cough reflex 

    **Lung resections**: pneumonectomy (remove a whole lung), lobectomy (remove a lobe), or segmentectomy (remove a bronchopulmonary segment)

    **Segmental atelectasis**: blockage a segmental bronchus > air in blocked gradually absorbed > segment collapse 

    **Pulmonary embolism**: obstruction of pulmonary artery by blood clot, causing acute respiratory distress (decrease oxygenation of blood) and acute cor pulmonale (acutely dilated right heart), may lead to pulmonary infarct (an area of necrotic lung tissue)

    **Lymphatic drainage and pleural adhesion**: pleural adhesion may cause anastomose of lymphatic vessels of lungs and parietal pleura, presence of carbon particles in axillary lymph nodes is evidence

    **Hemoptysis**: spitting blood or blood-stained sputum, mostly from bronchial arteries 

    **Bronchogenic carcinoma**: refer to lung cancer, mostly arise in mucosa of large bronchi and produce persistent cough or hemoptysis, metastasize early to thoracic lymph node, invade sinudoid or venule of lung and metastasize hematogenously, supraclavicualr lymph nodes commonly enlarge

    **Lung cancer and mediastinal nerves**: lung cancer may involve phrenic nerve (causing paralysis of hemidiaphragm) or recurrent laryngeal nerve (causing paralysis of vocal fold and hoarseness)

    **Pleural pain**: visceral pleura is insensitive but parietal is extremely sensitive to pain, irritation may produce local or referred pain 

    **Chest x-ray**: PA radiograph or lateral radiograph, clavicles & ribs and some vertebrae are visible, right dome of diaphragm is higher, lungs are relatively lucent, pulmonary arteries are visible in hilar region 

Overview of Mediastinum 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Mediastinum: central compartment of thoracic cavity, from superior thoracic aperture to diaphragm, from sternum and costal cartilages to thoracic vertebrae 
- Looseness of tissue around mediastinum enable it to accommodate movement and volume & pressure changes 
- Divided into:

  - **superior mediastinum**: from superior thoracic aperture to **thransverse thoracic plane** (horizontal plane including sternal angle and T4-T5 IV disc)
  - **inferior mediastinum**: from transverse thoracic plane to diaphragm, divided into anterior mediastinum, **middle mediastinum** (pericardium and its contents), posterior mediastinum 

Pericardium 
^^^^^^^^^^^

- Middle mediastinum: includes pericardium, heart, roots of great vessels 
- **Pericardium**: membrane covering heart and beginning of great vessels, include external fibrous pericardium and internal visceral pericardium 
- **Fibrous pericardium**: 

  - continuous superiorly with tunica adventitia of great vessels, attached anteriorly to sternum by **sternopericardial ligaments**, bound posteriorly to posterior mediastinum, continuous inferiorly with central tendon of diaphragm (**pericardiacophrenic ligament**)
  - protects heart against overfilling

- **Serous pericarium**: 

  - include **parietal layer** and **visceral layer**, reflect at great vessels
  - visceral layer of serous pericardium forms epicardium

- **Pericardial cavity**: potential space between parietal and visceral layers of serour pericardium 
- **Transverse pericardial sinus**: passage within pericardial cavity, posterior to intrapericardial parts of pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta, anterior to SVC, superior to atria of heart 
- **Oblique pericardial sinus**: recess in pericardial cavity, posterior to base of heart, bound laterally by pulmonary veins and IVC
- **Arterial supply of pericardium**: mainly from **pericardiocophrenic artery** that often accompanies phrenic nerve, smaller contribution from musculophrenic, bronchial, esophageal, superior phrenic, coranary artiries 
- **Venous drainage of pericardium**: pericardiacophrenic veins and azugos venous system 
- **Nerve supply of pericardium**: phrenic nerves (commonly reffered to ipsilateral supraclavicular region), vagus nerves, sympathetic trunks
