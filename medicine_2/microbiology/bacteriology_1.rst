================

Staphylococcus and Related Gram-Positive Cocci 
----------------------------------------------

- Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus (catalase positive), Streptococcus & Enterococcus (catalase negative)
- Staphylococcus: grow and cause disease in various conditions, found on skin and mucous membrane of humans, important pathogen
- Species: **S.aureus** (**coagulase positive**, most virulent, **MRSA**), **S.epidermidis**, **S.lugdunensis**, **S.saprophyticus** (**coagulase negative**, less virulent)

Physiology and Structure 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Capsule and Slime Layer
"""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Polysaccharide capsule**: inhibit phagocytosis by PMNs 
- **Slime layer** (**biofilm**): binds bacteria to tissues and foreign bodies

Peptidoglycan and Associated Enzymes 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Gram-positive bacteria cell wall: thick **peptidoglycan** layer with **many cross-linked layers** making it rigid 
- **Penicillin-binding protein**: 

  - **enzymes** that catalyze construction of peptigoglycan layer
  - targets of penicillins and other β-lactam antibiotics
  - bacterial resistance from acquisition of gene coding for novel penicillin-binding protein, ex: **mecA** gene in **MRSA**

- Peptidoglycan has endotoxin-like activity, stimulates immune responses

Teichoic Acids and Lipoteichoic Acids 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Teichoic acids**: **species-specific** component of cell wall, binds to peptidoglycan layer or cytoplasmic membrane (**lipoteichoic acids**)

Surface Adhesion Proteins 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Also called **microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMN) proteins**
- Including staphylococcal protein A, fibronectin-binding proteins A & B, clumping factor proteins A & B (**coagulase**)
- Functions: bind organisms to host cells and establish infection, some are unique to S.aureus and serve for identification 

Cytoplasmic Membrane 
""""""""""""""""""""

- Cytoplasmic membrane: osmotic barrier and providing anchorage for enzymes 

Pathogenesis and Immunity 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Pathogenesis: **evade**, **adherence**, **tissue destruction**

Regulation of Virulence Genes 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Accessory gene regulator (agr) operon**: regulate protein expression based on population density (low density: colonization and growth, high density: invasion)
- Innate immune regulation: apolipoprotein suppresses agr signaling

Defenses Against Innate Immunity 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Capsule** and **slime layer**: inhibits phagocytosis 
- **Protein A**: bind to immonoglobulins and prevents antibody-mediated clearance

Staphylococcal Toxins 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Includes cytotoxins, exfoliative toxins, enterotoxins, TSST-1.
- **Superantigens**: 

  - include exfoliative toxin A, enterotoxins, TSST-1 
  - bind to MHC II, interact with **VβTCR**, result in massive release of cytokines

Cytotoxins 
''''''''''

- **Alpha toxin**: bind to cell surface and form pore, lead to osmotic swelling and cell lysis 
- **Beta toxin**: also called **sphingomyelinase C**, catalyze hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids
- **Delta toxin**: has cytolytic activity
- **Gamma toxin** & **P-V leukocidin**: bicomponent toxins, hemolytic or leukotoxic 

Exfoliative Toxins  
''''''''''''''''''

- Two forms ETA & ETB, cause **SSSS** (characterized by exfoliative dermatitis)
- Are **serine proteases** that split desmosomes, typically no staphylococci nor leukocytes in involved layer (**diagnostic clue**)

Enterotoxins 
''''''''''''

- **Staphylococcal enterotoxins**: including enterotoxin A (food poisoning), B, C, D, heat stable and resistive to gastric enzymes
- Are **superantigens** causing non-specific T-cell activation and cytokine release 

Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **TSST-1**: Cause TSS (menstruation-associated or nonmenstruation-associated)
- Is **superantigen** responsible for systemic effects, may cause death by hypovolemic shock leading to multiorgan failure

Staphylococcal Enzymes 
""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Coagulase** in S. aureus: convert fibrinogen to fibrin, bound form (directly) and free form (reacting with **coagulase-reacting factor**)
- Staphylococcus also produce **hyaluronidase**, **fibrinolysin**, **lipases**, **nuclease**

Epidemiology
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Ubiquitous**, transient or persistent colonization on skin and **nasopharynx**
- Transferred through direct contact or contact with fomites 
- MRSA spread rapidly, complicating the control measures previously established 

Clinical Diseases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Staphylococcus Aureus 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Diseases result from toxin activity or proliferation of organism

Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- SSSS or **Ritter disease**: localized perioral erythema > spread over entire body > cutaneous blisters form > desquamation of epithelium > recover without scarring when antibodies appear
- Primarily in neonates and young children, mortality low, cause death by secondary infections 
- **Bullous impetigo**: localized form of SSSS

Staphylococcal Food Poisoning 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Intoxication** rather than infection, result from contamination of food by human carrier (including asymptomatic colonization), heating cannot inactive the **heat-stable** toxin 
- Commonly contaminated food: **processed meats**, **custard**-filled **pastries**, **potato salad**, **ice cream**
- Rapid onset (incubation period 4 hours) and rapid course (less than 24 hours), due to preformed and not further generated toxin 
- Severe vomiting, diarrhea (watery but non-bloody), abdominal pain, no fever
- Organisms or toxin can be cultured or tested in food, but diagnosis is primarily based on clinical picture 
- Treatment for abdominal cramping and diarrhea, antibiotic not used (diseases from toxin not organism)
- **Enterocolitis**: growth of S. aureus in colon after broad-spectrum antibiotics, diagnosed by excluding Clostridium difficile colitis and detecting S. aureus in stool 

Toxic Shock Syndrome 
''''''''''''''''''''

- **Toxic shock syndrome**: systemic disease, associated with menstruating women (S. aureus grows in tampons)
- Growth of S. aureus in vagina or wound > release of toxin into blood > fever, hypotension, rash, multiple organ systems are involved, entire skin desquamates
- **Purpura fulminans** is a virulent form of TSS, with large purpuric skin lesion, fever, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Patients with TSS who fail to develop antibodies are at risk of **recurrent disease**

Cutaneous Infections
''''''''''''''''''''

- **Pyogenic cutaneous infections**: including impetigo, foliculitis, furuncles, carbuncles
- **Impetigo**: affect young children, primarily on face and limbs, macule > pus-filled vesicle (**pustule**) > crusting 
- **Folliculitis**: pyogenic infection in hair follicles, **sty. Furuncles** is an extension of folliculitis with large painful raised nodules 
- **Carbuncles**: furuncles coalescing and extending to deeper subcutaneous tissue, with systemic spread (chills and fevers)
- **Wound infections**: occur after surgical procedure of trauma, managed by reopening wound, removing foreign bodies, draining, cleaning, and antibiotic therapy 
- **MRSA strains in the community**: common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections

Bacteremia and Endocarditis 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Bacteremia**: from unknown or innocuous skin infection, from surgical procedure or catheter in hospital, prolonged episodes are associated with dissemination to other body sites 
- **Endocarditis**: high mortality, from influenza-like symptoms to disruption of cardiac output and septic embolization (right-side involvement and pulmonary emboli in drug abusers), immediate intervention is crucial

Pneumonia and Empyema 
'''''''''''''''''''''

- **Aspiration pneumonia** (in the young or elderly, cystic fibrosis, influenza, COPD, bronchiectasis), **hematogenous pneumonia** (from bacteremia or endocarsitis), **necrotizing pneumonia** (by MRSA, with massive hemoptysis), **empyema** sometimes occur 

Osteomyelitis and Septic Arthritis 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Osteomyelitis**: from hematogenous dissemination or trauma, usually involve metaphyseal area of long bones in children, characterized by sudden onset of localized pain and high fever 
- Osteomyelitis in adults commonly occurs as vertebral osteomyelitis, characterized by intense back pain and fever, **Brodie abscess** is staphylococcal osteomyelitis in long bone of adults
- **Septic arthritis**: from intraarticular injections or mechanically abnormal joints, characterized by painful erythematous joint and purulent material obtained on aspiration

Staphylococcus Epidermidis and Other Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Endocarditis
''''''''''''

- Native valve endocarditis: **S. lugdunensis** commonly associated, but streptococci more common 
- **Endocarditis of artificial valves**: staphylococci are major cause, infection on suture line of valve and cause valve separation

Catheter and Shunt Infections 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Coagulase-negative staphylococci are common causes of catheter and shunt infections (due to production of polysaccharide slime for bonding and protecting)
- Persistent bacteremia is generally observed, glomerulonephritis occurs in long-standing diseases 

Prosthetic Joint Infections 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- With localized pain and mechanical failure (systemic signs not prominent and negative blood culture), treatment consists of joint replacement and antimicrobial therapy 

Urinary Tract Infections 
''''''''''''''''''''''''

- S.saprophyticus causes UTI in sexually active women, with dysuria, pyuria, and organisms in urine

Laboratory Diagnosis 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Microscopy
""""""""""

- **Gram-positive cocci** forming **clusters** on agar media, abundant organisms in deep specimen but few organisms in aspirated pus and superficial specimens, blood specimens should be cultured (few organisms in blood)
- Staphylococcal are seen in nasopharynx and vagina of patients with SSSS and TSS but cannot be distinguished from normally colonizing organisms

Nucleic Acid-based Tests
""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Nucleic acid amplification tests for direct detection and identification of S. aureus in specimens 

Culture
"""""""

- Culture on enriched agar media supplemented with sheep blood, grow rapidly aerobically or anaerobically (S. aureus colonies will turn **yellow**), produce hemolysis 
- Isolated selectively by **chromogenic agar** (characteristic color of S. aureus), **mannitol-salt agar** (fermented by S. aureus only), or 7.5% sodium chloride (inhibit growth of other organisms)

Identification 
""""""""""""""

- S.aureus identified by simple biochemical tests (eg. positive reaction of **coagulase**, by mixing organism with plasma)
- Mass spectrometry is accurate and fast, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or whole genome sequencing for characterizing at subspecies levels 

Antibody Detection 
""""""""""""""""""

- Test antibodies to cell wall teichoic acids, less sensitive

Treatment, Prevention, and Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Staphylococci develop resistance to penicillin (by **penicillinase**) and **semisynthetic penicillins** (eg. methicillin), MRSA are resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics, resistance may no express in susceptibility tests (**heterogeneous resistance**)
- Localized infections can be managed by incision and drainage, systemic involvement requires antibiotic therapy
- Oral therapy: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetraclycin, clindamycin or linezolid / Intravenous therapy: vancomycin (alternatives: daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid)
- Vancomycin is the current antibiotic of choice for serious infections, but **resistance to vancomycin** have now been found 
- **Infectoius dose** is generally large, so proper cleansing and disinfectant prevent most infections
- Spread of staphylococci from person to person (eg. surgical wound infections) is difficult to prevent, proper handwashing and covering of exposed skin surfaces help prevent
