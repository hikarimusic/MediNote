================

Staphylococcus and Related Gram-Positive Cocci 
----------------------------------------------

- Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus (catalase positive), Streptococcus & Enterococcus (catalase negative)
- Staphylococcus: grow and cause disease in various conditions, found on skin and musous membrane of humans, important pathogen
- Species: **S.aureus** (**coagulase positive**, most virulent, **MRSA**), **S.epidermidis**, **S.lugdunensis**, **S.saprophyticus** (**coagulase negative**, less virulent)

Physiology and Structure 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Capsule and Slime Layer
"""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Polysaccharide capsule**: inhibit phagocytosis by PMNs 
- **Slime layer** (**biofilm**): binds bacteria to tissues and foreign bodies

Peptidoglycan and Associated Enzymes 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Gram-positive bacteria cell wall: thick **peptidoglycan** layer with **many cross-linked layers** making it rigid 
- **Penicillin-binding protein**: 

  - **enzymes** that catalyze construction of peptigoglycan layer
  - targets of penicillins and other β-lactam antibiotics
  - bacterial resistance from acquisition of gene coding for novel penicillin-binding protein, ex: **mecA** gene in **MRSA**

- Peptidoglycan has endotoxin-like activity, stimulates immune responses

Teichoic Acids and Lipoteichoic Acids 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Teichoic acids**: **species-specific** component of cell wall, binds to peptidoglycan layer or cytoplasmic membrane (**lipoteichoic acids**)

Surface Adhesion Proteins 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Also called **microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMN) proteins**
- Including staphylococcal protein A, fibronectin-binding proteins A & B, clumping factor proteins A & B (**coagulase**)
- Functions: bind organisms to host cells and establish infection, some are unique to S.aureus and serve for identification 

Cytoplasmic Membrane 
""""""""""""""""""""

- Cytoplasmic membrane: osmotic barrier and providing anchorage for enzymes 

Pathogenesis and Immunity 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Pathogenesis: **evade**, **adherence**, **tissue destruction**

Regulation of Virulence Genes 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Accessory gene regulator (agr) operon**: regulate protein expression based on population density (low density: colonization and growth, high density: invasion)
- Innate immune regulation: apolipoprotein suppresses agr signaling

Defenses Against Innate Immunity 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Capsule** and **slime layer**: inhibits phagocytosis 
- **Protein A**: bind to immonoglobulins and prevents antibody-mediated clearance

Staphylococcal Toxins 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Includes cytotoxins, exfoliative toxins, enterotoxins. TSST-1.
- **Superantigens**: 
  - include exfoliative toxin A, enterotoxins, TSST-1 
  - bind to MHC II, interact with **VβTCR**, result in massive release of cytokines

Cytotoxins 
''''''''''

- **Alpha toxin**: bind to cell surface and form pore, lead to osmotic swelling and cell lysis 
- **Beta toxin**: also called **sphingomyelinase C**, catalyze hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids
- **Delta toxin**: has cytolytic activity
- **Gemma toxin** & **P-V leukocidin**: bicomponent toxins, hemolytic or leukotoxic 

Exfoliative Toxins  
''''''''''''''''''

- Two forms ETA & ETB, cause **SSSS** (characterized by exfoliative dermatitis)
- Are **serine proteases** that split desmosomes, typically no staphylococci nor leukocytes in involved layer (**diagnostic clue**)

Enterotoxins 
''''''''''''

- **Staphylococcal enterotoxins**: including enterotoxin A (food poisoning) B C D, heat stable and resistive to gastric enzymes
- Are **superantigens** causing non-specific T-cell activation and cytokine release 

Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **TSST-1**: Cause TSS (menstruation-associated or nonmenstruation-associated)
- Is **superantigen** responsible for systemic effects, may cause death by hypovolemic shock leading to multiorgan failure

Staphylococcal Enzymes 
""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Coagulase** in S. aureus: convert fibrinogen to fibrin, bound form (directly) and free form (reacting with **coagulase-reacting factor**)
- Staphylococcus also produce **hyaluronidase**, **fibrinolysin**, **lipases**, **nuclease**

Epidemiology
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Ubiquitous**, transient or persistent colonization on skin and **nasopharynx**
- Transferred through direct contact or contact with fomites 
- MRSA spread rapidly, complicating the control measures previously established 

Clinical Diseases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Staphylococcus Aureus 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Diseases result from toxin activity or proliferation of organism

Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- SSSS or **Ritter disease**: localized perioral erythema > spread over entire body > cutaneous blisters form > desquamation of epithelium > recover without scarring when antibodies appear
- Primarily in neonates and young children, mortality low, cause death by secondary infections 
- **Bullous impetigo**: localized form of SSSS

Staphylococcal Food Poisoning 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Intoxication** rather than infection, result from contamination of food by human carrier (including asymptomatic colonization), heating cannot inactive the **heat-stable** toxin 
- Commonly contaminated food: **processed meats**, **custard**-filled **pastries**, **potato salad**, **ice cream**
- Rapid onset (incubation period 4 hours) and rapid course (less than 24 hours), due to preformed and not further generated toxin 
- Severe vomiting, diarrhea (watery but non-bloody), abdominal pain, no fever
- Organisms or toxin can be cultured or tested in food, but diagnosis is primarily based on clinical picture 
- Treatment for abdominal cramping and diarrhea, antibiotic not used (diseases from toxin not organism)
- **Enterocolitis**: growth of S. aureus in colon after broad-spectrum antibiotics, diagnosed by excluding Clostridium difficile colitis and detecting S. aureus in stool
