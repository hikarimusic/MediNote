Pathogenesis and Immunity 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Pathogenesis: **evade**, **adherence**, **tissue destruction**

Regulation of Virulence Genes 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Accessory gene regulator (agr) operon**: regulate protein expression based on population density (low density: colonization and growth, high density: invasion)
- Innate immune regulation: apolipoprotein suppresses agr signaling

Defenses Against Innate Immunity 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Capsule** and **slime layer**: inhibits phagocytosis 
- **Protein A**: bind to immonoglobulins and prevents antibody-mediated clearance

Cytotoxins 
''''''''''

- **Alpha toxin**: bind to cell surface and form pore, lead to osmotic swelling and cell lysis 
- **Beta toxin**: also called **sphingomyelinase C**, catalyze hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids
- **Delta toxin**: has cytolytic activity
- **Gamma toxin** & **P-V leukocidin**: bicomponent toxins, hemolytic or leukotoxic 

Exfoliative Toxins

Clinical Diseases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Staphylococcus Aureus 
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Diseases result from toxin activity or proliferation of organism

Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- SSSS or **Ritter disease**: localized perioral erythema > spread over entire body > cutaneous blisters form > desquamation of epithelium > recover without scarring when antibodies appear
- Primarily in neonates and young children, mortality low, cause death by secondary infections 
- **Bullous impetigo**: localized form of SSSS

Staphylococcal Food Poisoning 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Intoxication** rather than infection, result from contamination of food by human carrier (including asymptomatic colonization), heating cannot inactive the **heat-stable** toxin 
- Commonly contaminated food: **processed meats**, **custard**-filled **pastries**, **potato salad**, **ice cream**
- Rapid onset (incubation period 4 hours) and rapid course (less than 24 hours), due to preformed and not further generated toxin 
- Severe vomiting, diarrhea (watery but non-bloody), abdominal pain, no fever
- Organisms or toxin can be cultured or tested in food, but diagnosis is primarily based on clinical picture 
- Treatment for abdominal cramping and diarrhea, antibiotic not used (diseases from toxin not organism)
- **Enterocolitis**: growth of S. aureus in colon after broad-spectrum antibiotics, diagnosed by excluding Clostridium difficile colitis and detecting S. aureus in stool 

Toxic Shock Syndrome 
''''''''''''''''''''

- **Toxic shock syndrome**: systemic disease, associated with menstruating women (S. aureus grows in tampons)
- Growth of S. aureus in vagina or wound > release of toxin into blood > fever, hypotension, rash, multiple organ systems are involved, entire skin desquamates
- **Purpura fulminans** is a virulent form of TSS, with large purpuric skin lesion, fever, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Patients with TSS who fail to develop antibodies are at risk of **recurrent disease**

Cutaneous Infections
''''''''''''''''''''

- **Pyogenic cutaneous infections**: including impetigo, foliculitis, furuncles, carbuncles
- **Impetigo**: affect young children, primarily on face and limbs, macule > pus-filled vesicle (**pustule**) > crusting 
- **Folliculitis**: pyogenic infection in hair follicles, **sty. Furuncles** is an extension of folliculitis with large painful raised nodules 
- **Carbuncles**: furuncles coalescing and extending to deeper subcutaneous tissue, with systemic spread (chills and fevers)
- **Wound infections**: occur after surgical procedure of trauma, managed by reopening wound, removing foreign bodies, draining, cleaning, and antibiotic therapy 
- **MRSA strains in the community**: common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections

Bacteremia and Endocarditis 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Bacteremia**: from unknown or innocuous skin infection, from surgical procedure or catheter in hospital, prolonged episodes are associated with dissemination to other body sites 
- **Endocarditis**: high mortality, from influenza-like symptoms to disruption of cardiac output and septic embolization (right-side involvement and pulmonary emboli in drug abusers), immediate intervention is crucial

Pneumonia and Empyema 
'''''''''''''''''''''

- **Aspiration pneumonia** (in the young or elderly, cystic fibrosis, influenza, COPD, bronchiectasis), **hematogenous pneumonia** (from bacteremia or endocarsitis), **necrotizing pneumonia** (by MRSA, with massive hemoptysis), **empyema** sometimes occur 

Osteomyelitis and Septic Arthritis 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Osteomyelitis**: from hematogenous dissemination or trauma, usually involve metaphyseal area of long bones in children, characterized by sudden onset of localized pain and high fever 
- Osteomyelitis in adults commonly occurs as vertebral osteomyelitis, characterized by intense back pain and fever, **Brodie abscess** is staphylococcal osteomyelitis in long bone of adults
- **Septic arthritis**: from intraarticular injections or mechanically abnormal joints, characterized by painful erythematous joint and purulent material obtained on aspiration

Staphylococcus Epidermidis and Other Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Endocarditis
''''''''''''

- Native valve endocarditis: **S. lugdunensis** commonly associated, but streptococci more common 
- **Endocarditis of artificial valves**: staphylococci are major cause, infection on suture line of valve and cause valve separation

Catheter and Shunt Infections 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Coagulase-negative staphylococci are common causes of catheter and shunt infections (due to production of polysaccharide slime for bonding and protecting)
- Persistent bacteremia is generally observed, glomerulonephritis occurs in long-standing diseases 

Prosthetic Joint Infections 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- With localized pain and mechanical failure (systemic signs not prominent and negative blood culture), treatment consists of joint replacement and antimicrobial therapy 

Urinary Tract Infections 
''''''''''''''''''''''''

- S.saprophyticus causes UTI in sexually active women, with dysuria, pyuria, and organisms in urine

Laboratory Diagnosis 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Microscopy
""""""""""

- **Gram-positive cocci** forming **clusters** on agar media, abundant organisms in deep specimen but few organisms in aspirated pus and superficial specimens, blood specimens should be cultured (few organisms in blood)
- Staphylococcal are seen in nasopharynx and vagina of patients with SSSS and TSS but cannot be distinguished from normally colonizing organisms

Nucleic Acid-based Tests
""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Nucleic acid amplification tests for direct detection and identification of S. aureus in specimens 

Culture
"""""""

- Culture on enriched agar media supplemented with sheep blood, grow rapidly aerobically or anaerobically (S. aureus colonies will turn **yellow**), produce hemolysis 
- Isolated selectively by **chromogenic agar** (characteristic color of S. aureus), **mannitol-salt agar** (fermented by S. aureus only), or 7.5% sodium chloride (inhibit growth of other organisms)

Identification 
""""""""""""""

- S.aureus identified by simple biochemical tests (eg. positive reaction of **coagulase**, by mixing organism with plasma)
- Mass spectrometry is accurate and fast, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or whole genome sequencing for characterizing at subspecies levels 

Antibody Detection 
""""""""""""""""""

- Test antibodies to cell wall teichoic acids, less sensitive

Treatment, Prevention, and Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Staphylococci develop resistance to penicillin (by **penicillinase**) and **semisynthetic penicillins** (eg. methicillin), MRSA are resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics, resistance may no express in susceptibility tests (**heterogeneous resistance**)
- Localized infections can be managed by incision and drainage, systemic involvement requires antibiotic therapy
- Oral therapy: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetraclycin, clindamycin or linezolid / Intravenous therapy: vancomycin (alternatives: daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid)
- Vancomycin is the current antibiotic of choice for serious infections, but **resistance to vancomycin** have now been found 
- **Infectoius dose** is generally large, so proper cleansing and disinfectant prevent most infections
- Spread of staphylococci from person to person (eg. surgical wound infections) is difficult to prevent, proper handwashing and covering of exposed skin surfaces help prevent

Streptococcus and Enterococcus 
------------------------------

- Gram-positive cocci in pairs or chains, facultative anaerobes, complex nutritional requirement, fermenting carbohydrates, catalase negative
- Classification schemes:

  - serologic properties: **Lancefield groupings** (A to W)
  - **hemolytic patterns**: complete (β) hemolysis, incomplete (α) hemolysis, no (γ) hemolysis
  - **biochemical (physiologic) properties** 

- Major groups:

  - β-hemolytic streptococci: classified by Lancefield grouping (detecting group-specific cell wall antigens by immunologic assays)
  - α-hemolytic and γ-hemolytic streptococci (**viridans streptococci**): classified by biochemical testing into five groups
  - enterococci (**group D streptococci**): share **group D cell wall antigen**, including **Enterococcus faecalis**, **E. faecium**, **E. gallinarum**, **E. casseliflavus**

Streptococcus Pyogenes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Cause a variety of suppurative (pus formation) and nonsuppurative diseases 

Physiology and Structure 
""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Cocci in short chains, optimal growth on enriched-blood agar media, small colonies with large zones of β-hemolysis
- Within peptidoglycan cell wall are **group-specific carbohydrates** (**Lancefield group A antigen**) and type-specific protein (**M protein**)
- M protein: 

  - anchored in cytoplasmic membrane (highly conserved) and protrude above cell surface (antigenic differences) 
  - divided into class I (exposd shared antigen, bacteria with it can cause rheumatic fever) and class II (no exposed shared antigen)
  - classification of S. pyogene based on emm gene encoding M proteins

- Other components in cell wall: **M-like surface proteins**, **lipoteichoic acid** and **F protein** (facilitate binding of host cells)
- Some strains have hyaluronic acid **capusle** (protecting function)

Pathogenesis and Immunity 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Initial Host-Parasite Interactions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Avoiding opsonization and phagocytosis**: **hyaluromic acid capsule** interferes with phagocytosis, **M proteins** and M-like proteins block activation of complement pathway (reduce and block the binding of C3b), **C5a peptidase** incativate C5a 
- **Adherence to host cells**: **lipoteichoic acid** (initial adherence), **M protein** and **F protein** (interact with specific receptors)
- **Invade epithelial cells**: **M protein** and  **F protein**

Toxins and Enzymes 
''''''''''''''''''

- **Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spe)**: include four distinct heat-labile toxins, are superantigens enhancing release of cytokines, responsible for severe streptococcal diseases 
- **Streptolysin S**: oxygen-stable nonimmunogenic hemolysin (responsible for β-hemolysis), produced in the presence of serum 
- **Streptolysin O**: oxygen-labile hemolysin related to toxins produced by other bacteria, **antistreptolysin O (ASO) antibodies** are useful for documenting recent infections (**ASO test**), inhibited by cholesterol in skin (cutaneous infections do not develop ASO antibodies)
- **Streptokinase (A & B)**: lyse blood clots by cleaving plasminogen and facilitate the rapid spread, **antistreptokinase antibodies** are useful markers for infection
- **DNases (A to D)**: not cytolitic but reduce viscosity of abscess material and facilitate spread, **anti-DNase B test** are important marker for cutaneous infections (no ASO antibodies in cutaneous infections)

Epidemiology 
""""""""""""

- Commonly cause pharyngitis and pyodrema 
- Can colonize oropharynx of heathly indivisuals without diseases, colonization is transient and regulated by specific immunity to M protein and competitive organisms 
- Disease caused by recently acquired strains, including phayngitis (spread through respiratory droplets in crowding) an soft-tissue infections (colonization and introduction into break in skin)

Clinical Diseases 
"""""""""""""""""

- Suppurative streptococcal disease: pharyngitis, pyoderma, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome 
- Nonsuupurative streptococcal disease: rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis 

Pharyngitis 
'''''''''''

- Sore throat, fever, erythematous pharynx with exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, difficult to differentiate from viral pharyngitis 
- **Scarlet fever**:

  - complication of streptococcal pharyngitis (occurs when bacteria is infected with bacteriophage and produce pryogenic exotoxin)
  - Diffuse erythematous rash from upper chest to extermities, **circumoral pallor**, **strawberry tongue**, **Pastia lines**, desquamation followed

Pyoderma 
''''''''

- **Pyoderma (impetigo)**: confined purulent infection of exposed skin, colonization after contact > introduction through break in skin > pustules develop and rupture and crust > systemic sign uncommon > secondary spread common 
- Seen primarily in young children with poor personal hygiene durign warm moist months, strains of streptococci causing skin infections differ from that of pharyngitis 

Erysipelas 
''''''''''

- **Erysipelas**: acute infection of skin with localized pain, inflammation, lymph node enlargement, systemic signs, 
- Commonly in young children or older adults, preceded by skin or respiratory tract infections 

Cellulitis 
''''''''''

- **Cellulitis**: involves both skin and deeper subcutaneous tissue, with local inflammation and systemic sign

Necrotizing Fasciitis 
'''''''''''''''''''''

- **Necrotizing fasciitis**: infection in the subcutaneous tissue, spreading along the fascial planes, with extensive destruction of muscle and fat 
- Introduced from break in skin > from cellulitis to bullae, gangrene and systemic sign > toxicity, multiorgan failure, death are hallmarks, must be treated aggressively with debridement

Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- **Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome**: From soft-tissue imflammation to shock and organ failure, many patients have bacteremia and necrotizing fasciitis (compared with S. aureus)
- Increased risk in HIV infection, cancer, diabetes mellitus, heart or pulmonary diseases, varicella zoster virus infection, intravenous drug abuser, and alcohol abuser
